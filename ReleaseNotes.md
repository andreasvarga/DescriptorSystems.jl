# Release Notes

## Version 0.4.0

This minor release includes new functions for advanced manipulation of transfer function matrices via their descriptor system realizations,
such as, the computation of additive spectral decompositions, the computation of nullspace bases, the solution of linear equations with rational matrices and the solution of minimal cover problems.

## Version 0.3.0

This minor release defines a new system theoretical object, the _rational transfer function_, and includes new functions which support the operations involving rational functions. Full support is also provided to build matrices with rational transfer function elements and constructors are provided to compute descriptor system realizations of rational matrices. Additionally, a function to convert a descriptor system description to a standard one and a second function to perform general bilinear transformation of descriptor systems have been implemented. A function for the generation of the transfer functions of some commonly used bilinear transformations (Cayley, Tustin, Moebius, etc.) is also provided.

## Version 0.2.0

This minor release includes new functions for the analysis of descriptor systems, such as for computation of poles and zeros,
evaluation of normal rank, evaluation of several system norms, as well as a collection of new functions for some basic coprime and inner-outer type factorizations.

## Version 0.1.0

This is the initial release providing a prototype implementation of the basic descriptor system object, jointly with functions to perform basic operations, connections and simplifications of descriptor system models.
