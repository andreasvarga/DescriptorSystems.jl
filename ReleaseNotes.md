# Release Notes

## Version 0.2.0

This minor release includes new functions for the analysis of descriptor systems, such as for computation of poles and zeros,
evaluation of normal rank, evaluation of several system norms, as well as a collection of new functions for some basic coprime and inner-outer type factorizations.

## Version 0.1.0

This is the initial release providing a prototype implementation of the basic descriptor system object, jointly with functions to perform basic operations, connections and simplifications of descriptor system models.
